Challenge_Title: "Unlock the Hidden Site"

Description: 
  In this **Capture the Flag (CTF)** challenge, students will apply key concepts from information security, specifically:

  - **Encryption**
  - **Encoding**
  - **Hashing**

  The challenge is to uncover a hidden link that leads to the solution. Two compressed files are involved, one containing an encrypted text file with the hidden link and the other as a decoy. Students must identify the correct file.

  Once the correct file is identified, students must unzip it, decrypt the text, and follow the hidden link to complete the challenge.

Tools:
  - Hash Tool
  - Unzipping software: WinRAR, 7-Zip
  - CyberChef
