# Challenge Title: "Unlock the Hidden Site"

In this **Capture the Flag (CTF)** challenge, students will apply key concepts from information security, specifically:

- **Encryption**
- **Tokenization**
- **Hashing**

to uncover a hidden link that leads to the solution. The challenge involves two compressed files: one containing an encrypted text file with the hidden link, and the other as a decoy. Students must identify the correct file.

Once the correct file is identified, students will need to unzip it, decrypt the text, and follow the hidden link to complete the challenge.

## Tools

To assist in solving the challenge, students are encouraged to use the following tools:

- **Hash Tool**
- **Unzipping software**: WinRAR, 7-Zip
- **CyberChef**

## Learning Objectives

This challenge emphasizes the practical application of encryption and hashing, enhancing students' understanding of cryptographic techniques in a real-world context.
