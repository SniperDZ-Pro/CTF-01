challenge_title: "Unlock the Hidden Site"

description: |
  In this **Capture the Flag (CTF)** challenge, students will apply key concepts from information security, specifically:

  - **Encryption**
  - **Tokenization**
  - **Hashing**

  to uncover a hidden link that leads to the solution. The challenge involves two compressed files: one containing an encrypted text file with the hidden link, and the other as a decoy. Students must identify the correct file.

  Once the correct file is identified, students will need to unzip it, decrypt the text, and follow the hidden link to complete the challenge.

tools:
  - Hash Tool
  - Unzipping software: WinRAR, 7-Zip
  - CyberChef
